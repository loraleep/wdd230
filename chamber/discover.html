        <h1>Population: 226,115</h1>
        <p>BOISE, Idaho (AP) — If Idaho is feeling growing pains, newly released data from the 2020 Census illustrates why.

            The states population grew by 17.3% over the past 10 years — second only to Utah, which saw an 18.4% percent change in population. Much of that growth was concentrated around the southwestern Idaho cities of Boise and Nampa, with Ada County growing by 26%.
            
            The Ada County city of Meridian, meanwhile, became one of the 10 fastest-growing cities in the U.S., jumping from just over 75,000 people in 2010 to more than 117,600 residents in 2020.
            
            The fast-growing population has contributed to a housing crunch that is reflected in the census data. While Idahos 10% home vacancy rate was close to the national average, would-be new residents can expect to struggle to find a place to live in southwestern Idaho, with Canyon County’s vacancy rate at a low 3.9%. Gem, Ada and Payette counties also had low vacancy rates at 4.8%.
